# GSC-Modifications

Making modifications to cod scripts, on going.
I update these as I find things that must be changed, and I change it in my raw instead of just for that map


Nothing changed should affect any original/sniper bolts stuff. Anything that worked before should still work, just with some improvements or options.


_zombiemode_weapons:
 - added ablility to include weapons here, and not needed in dlc3_code gsc anymore
 - added mule kick support
 - modified one weapon check for one wepaon, not zombie_colt
 - 
 
_zombiemode_blockers_new:
 - added electric on condition to debris
 - added script_sound kvp for debris to change sound it makes
 -
